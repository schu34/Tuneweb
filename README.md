keys.json
=========
In order to get related artists from lastfm you'll need an api key. You can grab one [here](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create) if you don't have one already.
Then just create a file called keys.json in the root directory with the following format: 

```
{
  "api_key": <your_api_key> ,  
  "secret" : <your_shared_secret>
}
```
